This is the initial design of the "Virtual Dunk Tank" from 2012.  It consisted of a large red button that would have a soft ball thrown at it.  If the ball hit the button, it would set off the spray sequence.  The sketch also has a small black button that can be pressed to start a spray sequence.  

This design target an Arduino Leonardo.
